# miniquery
your own jquery-like library

### Learning Competencies

- Create modular code in Javascript
- Implement a CSS selector library in Javascript
- Implement a DOM manipulation library in Javascript
- Implement an event dispatch library in Javascript
- Implement an HTTP request library in Javascript
- Understand and reimplement jQuery as a toolbelt of various individual libraries

### Summary

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a very popular Javascript toolbelt. It's a collection of tools, each of which allows you to do a very specific job:

  - Select elements with CSS: `$('#id')`, `$('.class')`, `$('element')`
  - Manipulate the DOM: `.show()`, `.hide()`, `.addClass()`, `.removeClass()`, etc.
  - Dispatch and listen for events: `.trigger()`, `.on()`
  - Send HTTP requests: `$.ajax()`

It's important to realize that jQuery is not just one thing, it's a collection of things grouped under one namespace. In fact, some parts of it could be used as standalone tools. For example, jQuery uses [Sizzle](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle) under the hood as its selector engine.

In this challenge we will decompose jQuery and reimplement some of its functionality. We'll start by implementing each tool on its own. Eventually, we will group everything together under one toolbelt: miniQuery. The objective is to remove the "magic" from jQuery and realize that it's nothing you couldn't write. It's also important to separate the different tools that jQuery provides you and to be able to identify them as separate components collected under one umbrella.

### Setting up the Application

In the repo, you'll find an `index.html` file and a `lib` folder. The `index.html` is very simple - it primarily links to our miniQuery library and allows us to test it easily. The `lib` folder contains `miniQuery.js`; this is where you'll be spending most of your time. You are **NOT** allowed to include jQuery or any other external library. This would defeat the purpose of this challenge! You are, however, encouraged to read the jQuery code and get inspired. You will be using the browser dev tools console to test your code.

### Releases

##### Release 0: A CSS selector library

Create a module called `SweetSelector` that allows us to do the following:

> Hint: you'll need to do this using [vanilla javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_elements.asp)

- select by `id`:
```javascript
SweetSelector.select('#eyed');
// should return <div id="eyed">eyed</div>
```

- select by `class`:
```javascript
SweetSelector.select('.klass');
// should return [<div class="klass">klass</div>, <div class="klass">klass</div>]
```

- select by `tag name`:
```javascript
SweetSelector.select('a');
// should return [<a href="#hello">click me</a>, <a href="#hello">click me</a>]
```

##### Release 1: DOM manipulation

Create a module called `DOM` that allows us to do the following:

- hide and show elements:
```javascript
DOM.hide('.klass') // hides the div
DOM.show('.klass') // shows the div
```

> Hint: What does hide actually do? Try it in jQuery, hide an element and inspect it. See anything different? Styling maybe?

- add and remove classes to/from elements:
```javascript
DOM.addClass('.klass', 'shadi')
// div.klass should look like this: <div class="klass shadi">klass</div>

DOM.removeClass('.klass', 'shadi')
// div.klass should look like this: <div class="klass">klass</div>
```

##### Release 2: Event dispatching

Create a module called `EventDispatcher` that allows us to do the following:

> Hint: Read about [events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events)

Implement the following functionalities:

```javascript
EventDispatcher.on('.klass', 'fakeEvent', function() { console.log('awesome') });
EventDispatcher.trigger('.klass', 'fakeEvent');
// this should print "awesome" in the console.
```

##### Release 3: AJAX

Create a module called `AjaxWrapper` that allows us to do the following:

Hints:
  * [using XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest)
  * [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

```javascript
// this should an ajax request to the url and call the success callback if successful and fail callback if unsuccessful.
AjaxWrapper.request({
 url: 'someurl',
 type: 'GET'
}).then(function(data, textStatus, xhr) {
  // Handle data returned from the Promise
}).fail(function(errorMessage, textStatus, xhr) {
  // Handle data returned from the Promise
});
```

##### Release 4: miniQuery

Let's namespace all of our tools/libraries into one awesome toolbelt: miniQuery. We want to be able to do the following:

```javascript
// selectors:
miniQuery('.klass')
miniQuery('#eyed')
miniQuery('a')

// DOM manipulation
miniQuery('.klass').hide();
miniQuery('.klass').show();
miniQuery('.klass').addClass('shadi');
miniQuery('.klass').removeClass('shadi');

// Event Dispatching
miniQuery('.klass').on('fakeEvent', function() { console.log('awesome') });
miniQuery('.klass').trigger('fakeEvent');

// AJAX
miniQuery.ajax({
 url: 'someurl',
 type: 'GET',
 success: function() {
   //do something
 },
 fail: function() {
  //do something
 }
});
```

- Start by creating a `miniQuery` module and move everything under it. You'll have a something like:

```javascript
miniQuery.DOM.hide('.klass');
miniQuery.AjaxWrapper.request({...});
```

- Move the selectors so they work directly from the `miniQuery` namespace. Don't move all of the functions straight under miniQuery module, think of a clean way to use them under the hood.
- Continue with the rest of the libraries and make sure you're not repeating yourself. Can the libraries use each other?
- Take small steps! Don't attempt to solve this all at once.

##### Release 5: Use $

`miniQuery` is too long to write; can we use `$` as well? Nothing should change, we'll just give the user the option to use `miniQuery` or `$`.
